# Introduction

The Clear Signing Alliance is a cross-ecosystem initiative committed to advancing human-readable and secure transaction signing for blockchain users. Our mission is to replace opaque, hexadecimal signing flows with clear, descriptive representations of transaction intent and parameters. By defining metadata schemas, maintaining an open registry, and providing tooling for wallets and developers, we aim to drive widespread adoption of clear signing. Through this effort, we strive to make signing blockchain operations intuitive, trustworthy, and resistant to user error and prevent some commmon misleading practices and malicious behaviors.
